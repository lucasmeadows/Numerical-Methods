# Numerical-Methods
Numerical methods projects

This repository contains homework assignments and projects from my Numerical Methods class, covering key topics like error analysis, interpolation, quadrature, and convergence. The goal is to implement and explore numerical techniques and their applications in scientific computing.

Contents

Error Analysis: Understanding and implementing methods to analyze numerical errors in computations.
Interpolation: Polynomial and spline interpolation techniques for estimating values within data sets.
Quadrature and Integration: Techniques for approximating integrals, including composite methods and Gaussian quadrature.
Convergence and Stability: Investigating convergence rates and stability of various numerical methods.
Files and Structure
Each topic is organized into its own folder with:

Code: Python scripts or notebooks implementing key algorithms for each method.
Notes: Supporting notes, explanations, and comments about each method.
Homework: Problem statements and solutions demonstrating the application of each technique.
